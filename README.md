# ProjectAtlantis
A full Management Game developed using C++ .

## Game Introduction 
Atlantis is a management game that tests the player’s ability to foresee, plan and productively manage time. The player is the archaeologist who has to renew and re-establish a city and develop it. But this is not as easy as it sounds for there are many deadly traps. The city has limited resources which can only be saved and balanced with proper planning. If the player is a little careless he might get stuck for a while when a resource has got depleted from which recovery is difficult. Secondly the player should also take care of the ecosystem ,which if he misses to take care the player will loose the city altogether. Furthermore the land is prone to disasters!!! Yes that is right. The player also has to save his city from disasters for which the player has to build a wall enclosing the city and protecting it from disasters.
